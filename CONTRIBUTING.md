## Branches management guidelines

* Default repository branch: `develop`. It contains all the latest changes, which are merged via the `Pull Requests`
* Any new features or bug fixes are implemented in the separate branches (`fn_`, `fix_`, etc.)
* Changes from the branches are merged into the `develop` after the `Pull Request` review
* If a certain state of the `develop` branch is considered as `feature-full` and `stable` - a release branch is created. It is immutable and keeps the code state for a specific point of time
* If a bug is uncovered in the `develop`, which also affects a certain release - the fix is cherry-picked into the `release` branch

## CI process description

* When a commit is pushed to the `develop` branch, AppVeyor runs a build process automatically. AppVeyor uses a configuration is defined in `.appveyor.yml` file during the build process.
* A AppVeyor build process executes `./gradlew -PbuildNumber=${APPVEYOR_BUILD_NUMBER}.${APPVEYOR_REPO_COMMIT} build zip --no-daemon` command on the `build_script` section.
* After a successful build, AppVeyor uploads the build result `fonda*.zip` to Amazon S3 `s3://fonda-oss-builds/builds/develop/` bucket automatically.
* To get the `fonda*.zip` from S3 bucket you can follow the link `https://fonda-oss-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/builds/develop/fonda-${APPVEYOR_BUILD_NUMBER}.${APPVEYOR_REPO_COMMIT}.zip` 
in your browser or download file from the command console by `wget` or `curl` commands.
```
1. Commit to "develop" branch
                |                               
                |                                                
                * <--- "fn_branch1" merge into "develop"        
               /|          
              / |
             /  |
            *   |                     
           / \  |
          /   \ |             
         /     \|
fn_branch1      | 
                |
                |
             develop

2. Run build command on the AppVeyor:

./gradlew -PbuildNumber=${APPVEYOR_BUILD_NUMBER}.${APPVEYOR_REPO_COMMIT} build zip --no-daemon

3. If the `step 2` success:
                                         _________
                                       // Amazon  \\

## Contributions

You can get started to contribute to the Fonda in several ways by creating:
- issue: [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs) or [suggesting enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)
- [pull requests](#pull-requests)

**Issues** are the way to track the problems, ideas, questions that would be raised while using the code in a repository.
These can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated. 
It can also be used to keep track of tasks, enhancements for the codebase.
The issue shall be discussed by repository maintainers and contributors first. If the issue is relevant and requires a solution, then it should be implemented and updated in the repository via pull request.

**Pull request** allows you made a feature implementation or a bug-fix in the code to a repository.  
Maintainers can see the changes and suggest modifications in the code. 
If the changes are acceptable, they can merge it to the branch requested.
